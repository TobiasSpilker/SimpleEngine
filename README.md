# SimpleEngine
SimpleEngine is a rudimentary game engine I'm working on using openTK and c#. This might turn into a game itself later on. Once it is completed enough you can download it from this page. Some code snippets are available and plenty of other information about the engine itself like terrain generation, rendering chunks, storage etc.. This page serves as a hub containing all the information about the program, new updates and where you can actually download it.
